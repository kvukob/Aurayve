Backend project for Aurayve.

Aurayve is a full stack trading exchange using fictional assests.  Users can trade different trading pairs which are priced against 'AYST', which is the platforms stablecoin.

Trading functionality is more akin to decentralized exchanges like Uniswap rather than centralized, order book based exchanges.  Aurayve uses 'liquidity pools' to determine price and allow for trading, while providing liquidity at any price.

Front end project to be added at a later date.  Both will move to closed source as project develops.
